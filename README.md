# Optimal_Control_Matching
This is the final deliverable for our MIT Capstone project in collaboration with TEA. We worked on a flexible script to evaluate treatment effects of observational studies. Since we don't have a random treatment population we built a matching algorithm to match similar treatment to control classes to derive the treatment effects.
